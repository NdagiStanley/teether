# 2019 - One Word #365

So for 2019, what word will I use? :thinking:

## Guiding principles

I really like Etymology (The study of origin of words). So based on this and my growing understanding of (and exposure to) Godâ€™s word I reasoned out a number of words and finally settle on one that I most identify with. The word sums up my vision for this year and most certainly contributes to my journey of becoming: **We are but most importantly we become**; life as nature is mostly fluid, not constant!

_Drumrolls_ :drum:

## The Word
