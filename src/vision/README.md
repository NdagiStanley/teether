# Vision

## Overview

Certain aspects of an individual's vision are personal and nuanced. We won't get into that. Here I'll share my approach to casting an annual personal vision.

### About my vision casting process

It's said _time and tide wait for no man_. As far as planning for one's time goes, I think that new year resolutions is the single most common time people zero-in on this. Yet, some forget theirs; days, if not weeks, later; clouded by the day-to-day of life. I too was a fan until recently.

## OneWord365

As an alternative to a long bulleted list forming a New Year’s resolution, I came across the [OneWord365][oneword]’s philosophy, in 2018. It advocates for choosing one word for the year instead. A word that sums up your vision for your year since one word is easier to remember than a page long new year's resolution.

> One word versus a one year resolution!

### Over the years

This is not a new concept in any sense. I know several churches, at least in my part of the world :smile:, that have a 'word' for the year annually. (_**word**_ is in quotes since it rarely is a single word)

This is how I do it. I stick to a single one! Basically, I prayerfully and meditatively settle on one word to guide me every year or more.

> Talk of the significance of words!

It is a matter of **Faith and Focus**, tried and tested over a few years so far. I recommend it whenever I can.

Here are my musings on the same:
