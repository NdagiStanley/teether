# Vision

It's said time and tide wait for no man. As far as planning for one's time goes, I think that new year resolutions is single most common time people zero-in on this. Yet, some forget weeks later, clouded by the day-to-day of life.

## OneWord365

An alternative to a long New Year’s resolution, I came across in 2018 is the [OneWord365][oneword]’s philosophy. It advocates for choosing one word for the year instead. This is not a new concept in any sense but, tried and tested, I recommend it whenever I can.

> One word versus resolution!

A word that sums up your vision for your year since one word is easier to remember than a page long new year's resolution.

This is how I do it. Basically, I prayerfully and meditatively settle on one word to guide me every year.

> Talk of the significance of words!

## Over the years

Here are my musings on the same, ever since.
