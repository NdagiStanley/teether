# Stan as a beta-tester

## Innovation Life Cycle

It goes by many names: Technology adoption model/ curve/ life cycle/...

When an idea or concept is introduced to a group of people/ the public, it gets accepted/ used at different pace by different societies/ markets. There are 5 segments of such:

- Innovators
- Early Adopters
- Early Majority
- Late Majority
- Laggards

## Wins and Losses

I have been an innovator, very few times. I think, maybe I have not gotten my niche yet, :sweat_smile:. I have however been in the early adopters and early majority camps and experienced wins and losses. Here are some:

- Some products fail to achieve profitability hence die out :-1:
- Some products are 'killed' (decommissioned) by their creators :angry:

  > Sometimes you're one of the many/ few who liked it)

  Examples:

  - Google+ [launched][g+ launch] then [shutdown][g+] by Google on April 2019
  - [Inbox by Google][inbox] shut down by Google on April 2, 2019

    Google is notorius for such. [Killedbygoogle.com][killed-by-google] is a site listing products that have been 'killed' by Google.

- Some products start as freemium then have a subscription/ paid product :roll_eyes: (Of course, they need to make money)

  Examples:

  - [Ratio by Blloc][ratio] (An Android launcher) - The subscription was too high for the value proposition for me.

- Some start out as a paid product then become freemium :shrug:

  > This can be considered a win since at one point you gave the team behind it some runway

- Some products are really good that what they supported becomes a feature in a supporting or competing product :monocle_face:

  Examples:

  - [Quicklyrics] shows lyrics for audio and video that's playing on your phone. Shazam; Apple Music and Spotify now have this as a feature somewhat.

- Some get bought by other stakeholders (Which might affect your user experience - positively/ negatively)

  Examples:

  - [Microsoft launcher][MS launcher] was formerly Arrow Launcher

- Early adopters sometimes are enrolled in a beta-testing program; hence they contribute to the future of the product (sometimes this comes with perks) :tada:

## Current products I'm a beta tester of

- GitHub (as a [GitHub Star][gh star] )
- [YouVersion][youversion]
