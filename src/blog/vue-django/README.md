# Vue-Django - 500 GitHub stars

> 500 GitHub stars and counting… :star: :star: :star:

On my _dated_ open-source page: [code.md.engineer][code.md], the first project I have quoted is [VueDjango][vue-django]; a full-featured Webpack setup of a VueJS 2.x app with hot-reload, lint-on-save, unit testing & css extraction integrated into a Django 2.x application.

It has over 500 stars on GitHub now! :fire:

> Context

_Python is my main tool of trade as a Software/ Data Engineer. In a previous project, I challenged myself to use Django and VueJS hand-in-hand. It was a [photo-editing application][sjourney] (Don’t mind the missing image on the homepage, **postimg.org** is no longer up. I use [imgur][imgur] these days :wink:) Here is its [codebase][sjourney-code]. I had worked on another application with the same technical requirements: VueJS and Django: [not-by-might][nbm]. The only difference between the two is that I used semantic UI on one (the former) and Bootstrap on another (the latter)._

Back to vue-django. This project has three variations:

- Django 1.\* - Vue 1.\*
- Django 1.\* - Vue 2.\*
- Django 2.\* - Vue 2.\*

It's made such that by following [these steps][steps], you have a project similar to what is hosted [here][vuedj] and you are ready to go.

## Community activity

Since this project was a fork from [vuejs-templates/webpack][templates] I decided to separate it so that I can track stars and forks. I looked forward to handling issues that are raised by people using this starter-pack and it proved successful.

Since then the project has had:

- [500+ stars][stars]
- [70+ forks][forks]
- [5 closed issues][issues] (user created)
- [An improved boilerplate][gitlab] based on VueDjango that includes CI/CD (Gitlab pipeline), Docker/Docker-Compose, Nginx, and PostgreSQL

Vue-Django is on [OpenCollective][opencollective] (should anyone want to back it or support the project)

I’m honoured. Let’s keep up the good work :muscle:.
