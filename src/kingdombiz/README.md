## What does KingdomBIZ mean?

Jesus Christ, believed to be the Son of God (the triune God), according to the Bible (a collection of books that has survived millennia whose authors claim to be inspired by God), is claimed to have said the following words:

> :speaking_head: "Did you not know that I must be about My Father’s business?"

::: details ☝️ Context (Expand to view)
Jesus and family went to Jerusalem for Passover every year. This time at age 12 he remains behind at the temple as the others head back. His parents think he's among the others but eventually realise that's not the case. He is 'lost'.
Jesus' parents (guardians) are searching for him. They find him back at the temple.

> :speaking_head: And He (Jesus) said to them (His parents), "Why did you seek Me? Did you not know that I must be about My Father’s business?"

That's [Luke 2:49 NKJV (New King James Version)][luke 2.49 nkjv]

[Other translations][luke 2.49]

> :speaking_head: "My nourishment comes from doing the will of God, who sent me, and from finishing his work."

He takes a breather at Jacob's well while His disciples went for 'shopping' (food shopping). This was at noon. A woman of Samaria is on an errand to fetch water and Jesus asks for a drink. Please note that [Samaritans and Jews had no dealings with each other][samaritans and jews]. So this is awkward for the lady. They **debate** (the word debate, loosely used here).

Jesus says He is the giver of living water that quenches all thirst. Jesus is called 'a prophet' because He exercised word of knowledge (revealing secrets about the Samaritan woman's love life). They speak on worship as well.

Just then his disciples come back, surprised that he's talking to the lady ([AMPC version expounds it as _a married woman_][john 4:27 ampc]) Well, the conversation ends; she leaves without her water jar to share with her people about the encounter. These Samaritans will eventually come back to the well and persuade Jesus to stay for a while, which He did. Many of them believed because of the lady's testimony. They say truly Jesus is the Savior (or Saviour [*British English*]) of the world, the Christ.

Meanwhile, in between the time of the Samaritan woman leaving and the arrival of the Samaritans; the disciples were urging Jesus to eat the food they had come back with to no avail. "Did anyone bring him food?" they wondered. Jesus had assured them that He had had food which they new nothing about. He further explained:

> :speaking_head: My food (nourishment) is to do the will (pleasure) of Him who sent Me and to accomplish and completely finish His work.

That's [John 4:34 AMPC (Amplified Bible, Classic Edition)][john 4:34 ampc]

[Other translations][john 4:34]

So what's the deal with the name **KingdomBIZ**.

Jesus said severally that the **Kingdom of God** is at hand. We see that as a pre-teen, Jesus stayed back in Jerusalem; thoroughly occupied with literature in the word of God, engaging with teachers. He called this, His Father's business; God's business. In the other passage, we see His magnificent obsession in doing God's will, so much so, that He says that's His food.

The two passages speak on Jesus' ideology on life. I am a believer of Jesus Christ growing day by day and I believe Christianity is all about this ideology;

- Doing God's will
- Being occupied with matters of the Kingdom of God
