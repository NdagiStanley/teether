# Domain names fiasco (a testimony)

It's been a pleasure being part of the [ToT tech team][tech-mail]. We have a simple yet profound mission:

> Exude excellence by priming the [mission][tot] to be a tech-first mission
>

We have this [team](https://www.youversion.com/careers/) as our pacesetters :sunglasses:

## TLDR

:bookmark: **TLDR** - Too long, don't read

Our spiritual father (otherwise referred to as PFA or Papa), officially [Prophet Dr. Fred Akama][pfa] recently announced the [signing of Testimony TV][TV signing] and the team was tasked to park domains for that.

Unfortunately, I hit a snug and the ideal scenario is totally ruined. Until it got fixed!

## The nitty-gritty

We found out that [testimony.tv][.tv] is already owned :face_with_head_bandage:. So our next alternative:

Domains: testimony-tv.org/ testimony-tv.com

![Domain names](../../../.vuepress/public/images/kb/domains.png)

Great! :+1: We're in business.

I initiated payment and was out of there. :trophy:

### :exploding_head: The fiasco

Not so fast. Moments later, I saw this:

![Cancelled order](../../../.vuepress/public/images/kb/cancelled.png)

Then this :exploding_head:

![One domain is unavailable](../../../.vuepress/public/images/kb/unavailable.png)

Yes, you saw it right. All of a sudden, [testimony-tv.org](http://testimony-tv.org/) was no longer available!

### :worried: Devastation

I was devastated on two fronts:

- professionally:

    I saw it as un-professionalism on my part. I had been a bit easy about the process, not quite prompt with the task. Then the payment gateway locked me out meaning that I could not even buy the available testimony-tv.com

- spiritually:

    First off, [testimony.tv][.tv] had required a price bargain which could have gone over $1500.

    ![Domain bargain](../../../.vuepress/public/images/kb/bargain.png)

    I admit that's a quality domain. Maybe we'll get it in time. Besides, [YouVersion][youversion] acquired [bible.com][bible.com] after several years.

    > :monocle_face: Did you know?
    >> The [Bible app][Bible app] has been sponsored by one man since 2012! According to Wikipedia, he's the billionaire entrepreneur owner of [Hobby Lobby][Hobby Lobby] (it might require you to use a VPN to connect), [David Green][David Green]). Talk about **Kingdom Financing**!

    Secondly, I felt this was opposition winning! Frustrating the efforts of this ministry in securing online presence.

So what do I do now? :thinking:

## The turn around

Pardon me, I'm going to be a bit technical here.

> Steps to victory (You've gotta celebrate your wins, even the small ones) :trophy:

### :detective: WHO IS lookup

After calming down and whispering a short "God intervene", I started with a **WHOIS** lookup. I hoped it would be public. Unfortunately no data could be found by the registrar's service.

However, on the terminal I got a clue: [pir.org][pir] :raised_eyebrow:

![whois](../../../.vuepress/public/images/kb/whois.png)

### :globe_with_meridians: ORG registry

I remembered some news about all **.org** domains. The ORG registry was privatized late that previous year. Here's a [comment][blog-comment] I had shared with my readers on this.

So what had that got to do with this? I don't know. It wasn't adding up because even with that fact, domain registrars can still sell .org domains.

On a hunch, read Holy Spirit direction, I signed up for an account in a random domain registrar but left it at that saying to myself, "Who am I kidding?"

I gave my mind a break from the concern.

### :inbox_tray: An email in the night

Sometimes I am a night owl, active at night; in the peace and quiet.

So I get this email:

  ![Email from epik](../../../.vuepress/public/images/kb/epik.png)

I follow-up, and unbelievably, I can register the two domains :muscle:

  ![Successful order](../../../.vuepress/public/images/kb/successful-order.png)

  ![Success message](../../../.vuepress/public/images/kb/success.png)

## Success

And it was a success, moreover cheaper :man_dancing:

![Receipt](../../../.vuepress/public/images/kb/receipt.png)

So now, while the Tech team is working on the page, here's the [Testimony-TV][-tv]) site. :sparkles:

I liked the parking page they give once you purchase. So much that I just edited it to fit.

  ![TV site](../../../.vuepress/public/images/kb/tv.png)

  ![TV site part b](../../../.vuepress/public/images/kb/tv-b.png)

> 🧐 I had thought against sharing the domain registrar then I remembered: most techies will do a WHOIS lookup so, why go through the trouble. :shrug:
>
> Check them out: [epik.com][epik] (They call themselves: *the Swiss Bank of domains* 🇨🇭)

For the record I use multiple domain registrars. I try not to have brand-loyalty with them.
