# Testimonies

Time and again [Rev 12:11][REV.12.11 NIV] is quoted to emphasize the power of a testimony.

> _They triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb and by **the word of their testimony**; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death._

Although, there's a lot to unpack from this verse, compare translations [here][REV.12.11], it's clear testimonies are powerful.

As a believer of Christ Jesus and the miracle working God, I repeatedly pause to thank God for who He is and what He's done. While He is omni-present, oftentimes He seems to be acting in the background. Even some claim that _Coincidence is God acting in the background_. :smile:
