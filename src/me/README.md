# About Stan

***Software Engineer | Digerati*** is the most concise way I, Stanley Ndagi, choose to describe myself.

Welcome to the long version of it, below.

Navigation is on the right sidebar.

## Who am I?

Stan

- :kenya: is Kenyan (by birth)
- :earth_africa: identifies as a global citizen
- :computer: mostly works from home
- :writing_hand: enjoys writing
- :hiking_boot: likes the outdoors (hiking, camping)
- :pray: is a believer of Jesus Christ ([More][kingdombiz])

## What do I do?

### Personal Mantra

> *Invoke the builder within and serve*

#### What does this mean?

Besides being a **creative head** (building stuff and tinkering) I like to believe that I go **beyond self** and work on impacting others.

This mantra reminds me of this identity; calling me to action!

#### Building & Serving

- Software engineering - [My Devstory][devstory].
- Teaching (wholesomely breaking barriers, real or imagined!)
- Taking up **Leadership** opportunities
- DIY - Do It Yourself projects
- **Mentoring**
- ... the list continues (It's a lifelong journey)

[TechKln community][tk] is a brainchild of mine.

### #OneWord365

It's said time and tide wait for no man. As far as planning for one's time goes, I think that new year resolutions is single most common time people zero-in on this. Yet, some forget weeks later, clouded by the day-to-day of life.

An alternative, I came across in 2018 is the [OneWord365 philosophy][OneWord356]. It's not a new concept in any sense but I recommend it whenever I can. Basically, you prayerfully and meditatively settle on one word to guide you every year - talk of the significance of words!
