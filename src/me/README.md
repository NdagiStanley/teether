# About Stan

**_Digerati_ | _Tinkerer_ ** is the most concise way I, Stanley Ndagi, choose to describe myself.

Welcome to the long version of it, below.

::: tip
<Tip/>
:::

## Who am I?

Stan

- :kenya: is Kenyan (by birth)
- :earth_africa: identifies as a global citizen
- :computer: mostly works remotely
- :writing_hand: enjoys writing
- :hiking_boot: likes the outdoors (hiking, camping)
- :pray: is a believer of Jesus Christ ([More][kingdombiz])

## What do I do?

### Personal Mantra

> _Invoke the builder within and serve_

#### What does this mean?

Besides being a **creative** (building stuff and tinkering) I choose to go **beyond self**, and work on impacting others. More specifically work-wise, I thrive as an enabler, inventor, and galvanizer (based on the [6 Working geniuses by Patrick Lencioni][working-genius] )

This mantra reminds me of this identity; calling me to action!

#### Building & Serving

- Software engineering
- Teaching (wholesomely breaking barriers, real or imagined!) - technical writing is an expression of this
- Leading - Taking up **Leadership** opportunities
- DIY - Do It Yourself projects
- **Mentoring**
- ... the list continues (It's a lifelong journey)

[TechKln community][tk], a tech-savvy community hailing from Kenya with members globally is a brainchild of mine.
